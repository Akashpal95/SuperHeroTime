# SuperHeroTime
A go-to place for all your superhero-trivia needs.
# Project Description
It is a simple web application to settle all your superhero related arguments made with HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript and love.
It has all the information about all the superheros you love which I have fetched from this "https://superheroapi.com/" API.
You can go to the website, login with facebook and start having fun with your newly acquired access-token or you can visit my
website which is hosted here at our beloved github.
